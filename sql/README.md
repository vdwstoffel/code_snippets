# Create Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE code_snippets;
```

# Create Table

To auto increase the primary key
1. MySQL: `AUTO_INCREMENT`
2. PostgreSQL: `SERIAL`
3. SQLite3: `AUTOINCREMENT`
   
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(250) UNIQUE,
    age INT
);
```
## Create Table with Foreign Key
```sql
CREATE TABLE platform (
    platform_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    platform_name VARCHAR(250),
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id)
);
```

# Drop Table
```sql
DROP TABLE users;
```

# Alter Table
```sql
-- Rename Table
ALTER TABLE users
RENAME TO new_users;

-- Rename COLUMN
ALTER TABLE new_users
RENAME COLUMN username TO new_username;

-- Drop COLUMN
ALTER TABLE new_users
DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS age;
```

# SELECT
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a database.
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;

SELECT * FROM users 
WHERE username = 'Stoffel';

SELECT username AS us 
FROM users;

SELECT * FROM users
ORDER BY username ASC/DESC;
```

# INSERT INTO
The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert new records in a table.
```sql
INSERT INTO users (username, age)
VALUES ('Stoffel', 30);
```

# UPDATE
The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table.
```sql
UPDATE users
SET username = 'stoffel_updated'
WHERE username = 'Stoffel'
RETURNING *; -- See output
```

# DELETE
The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records from a table.
```sql
-- Delete all
DELETE FROM users;

-- Delete on condition
DELETE FROM users
WHERE username = 'Christoff'
```

# COUNT
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

# LIMIT
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
LIMIT 5;
```

# JOIN
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
INNER JOIN platform
ON users.user_id = platform.user_id;
```

# GROUP BY
The GROUP BY statement is used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows.
```sql
SELECT age, COUNT(*) FROM users
GROUP BY age;

-- The HAVING clause is used to filter records that are returned by GROUP BY
SELECT age, COUNT (*) FROM users
GROUP BY age
HAVING age < 30;
```

# DISTINCT
The DISTINCT keyword is used to return only distinct (unique) values.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT age FROM users;
```

# IN
The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
```sql
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username
IN ('Stoffel', 'Mavis');
```

# LIKE
The LIKE operator is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.
```sql
-- Exact Pattern Match
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username LIKE 'Stof';

-- Use % for more than one pattern match
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username LIKE '%Stof%';

-- Use _ for more than one pattern match
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username LIKE 'Stof_';

-- Case Insensitive
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE username ILIKE '%stof%';
```

# Aggregate
```sql
SELECT MIN(age) FROM users;

SELECT MAX(age) FROM users;

SELECT SUM(age) FROM users;

SELECT AVG(age) FROM users;

SELECT ROUND(AVG(age)) FROM users;
```
