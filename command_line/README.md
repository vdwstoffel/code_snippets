# Navigation

```bash
pwd                 # Check entire working path

ls                  # List items in directory
    -l              # show info
    -a              # show hidden folder

cd path/to/foldfer  # change directory
cd ..               # go back one
cd ~                # go to root
```

# Files and Folders

```bash
touch filename              # create file
rm filename                 # remove file

mkdir foldername            # create folder
rm -r foldername            # remove folder

mv <source> <destination>   # move file/folder
mv currentname newname      # rename file/folder

cp <source> <destination>   # copy file/folder
```

# Working with files and folder

```bash
# display the contents of a file
less filename.txt
```

When viewing a file using less
- press `space` or `f` to go to the next page of the file
- press `b` to go back to the previous page
- press `Enter` or `Down arrow` to scroll by one line
- to search, type forward slash `/` followed by a pattern
- press `q` to quit

```bash
cat filename.txt        # printout file
head filename.txt       # print first 10 lines
tail filename.txt       # print last 10 lines
```

{% code title='Word Count' %}
```bash
# lines, word ,bytes, filename
wc filename.txt
#>> 52  244 1623 README.md

wc -l filename.txt      # number of words
wc -w filename.txt      # number of lines
```
{% endcode %}

{% code title="Sort" %}
```bash
sort filename       # sort lines from a-z
sort -r filename    # sort in reverse
sort -n filename    # sort numerically
sort -u filename    # ignore duplicates
```
{% endcode %}

## Sort files via size

```bash
ls -lh | sort -rhk 5
```

# Redirection

```bash
pwd > file.txt              # direct output to file
pwd >> file.txt             # append output to file

sort < file.txt             # standard input

cat nofile 2> error.txt     # direct errors to file
cat nofile 2>> error.txt    # append errors to file
```

# Piping

```bash
ls | sort -r 
```

# Find executable

```bash
which python
```

# Expansion & Substitution
 - `*`: one or char
 - `?`: one char 

```bash
ls *.html       # all that ends in .html
ls pic?.png     # find anything that is picX.png
ls pic[123].png # find anything in range. pic1.png pic2.png pic3.png
ls [^a]*        # will match any files that do NOT start with "a"
```

## Brace Expansion

```bash
touch page{1,2,3}.txt
```

will generate three new files: page1.txt, page2.txt, and page3.txt


# Find

`find <dir> -iname "<file>"`

```bash
find ./ -name "*.md"

# finding by type
find -type d
find -type f

# find by name
find -name hello    # case sensitive
find -iname hello   # case insensitive
```

# Grep

`grep PATTERN FILE`

```bash
grep Flask README.md
grep -i Flask README.md     # add -i to make case insensitive
grep -w git README.md       # add -w to match wholewords
grep -r "chicken"           # recursive search which will include all files under a directory
grep -c git README.md       # print number of matches

# Usefull argumets
-w # word
-i # ignore case
-r # recursive
-c # match count
-n # Line Number
-E # Extended Regex
```

# Permissions

```bash
## Who
# u - user (the owner of the file)
# g - group (members of the group the file belongs to
# o - others (the "world")
# a - all of the above

# + (plus sign) grants the permission
# = (equals sign) set a permission and removes others

## Which
# r - the read permission
